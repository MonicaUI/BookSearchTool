Technical Question

How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

Spent somewhere around 6 hours

a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

There are multiple things we can add and I wish to add,
1) Created Spinner properly so that spinner can be shown till API is fetched
2) Home page can be loaded with someother options like trending books
3) Jest might be added for all files
4) Redux could be used to store state

b. If you did't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to
explain what you would add.

1) Wish to add test for mock API, mock functions, snapshot for all files in jest

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen
language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

1) I have used SCSS in css which can be seen in Allbooks.scss file to show animation

$animationSpeed: 20s;
.slide-track {
        animation: scroll $animationSpeed linear infinite;
        display: flex;
        height: 200px;
    }
    
2) Used Spinner loading 

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Had experience in doing WDIO testing to automate performance. But no time to implement here but tried lighthouse to track the performance

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

Felt showing all the API response would mess up the page so kept a button which helps loading remaining response as needed

5. Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
